# What's this?
#
# This file compiles, builds, optimises and shrinks: logFarmDMS.jar
#
# Needs to be run from a Linux command line.
#
# It requires: proguard :: http://proguard.sourceforge.net/
# Proguard will optimise and shrink logFarmDMS.jar
# using the configuration file: proguard/logFarmDMS
#
# This file's permissions will need to be changed so:
# chmod 777 readyLogFarmDMS.sh
#
# The output file is: logFarmDMS.tar.gz
# To uncompress the output file:
# - Copy logFarmDMS.tar.gz to a computer.
# - Either use an Archive Manager type application such as: file-roller
#   or the command line: tar xvfz logFarmDMS.tar.gz
#
# All necessary library files are in place for logFarmDMS to work with:
# - Linux
# - MacOS
# - Windows
#
# I only have access to a Linux work station so I have not
# had an opportunity to test logFarmDMS on other Operating Systems.
